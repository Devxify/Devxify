                  Hi Folks,
                  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
                  I'm Ankit, the chief content writer (and owner) here at Devxify. Hope you are loving what I share, if not the do let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/devxify" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I am committed to make a better web by helping awesome people like you make their websites faster, <a href="/web-accessibility-guide/">accessible</a> and more ethical. Sometimes I also love to contribute to the community. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now all that's present, what about my past? So I started learning about the web in 2016, I was a noob then but fantasized to make supercool websites. I did everything to make my sites faster and look prettier (I still suck at design). This path took me to <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WordPress</a>, building websites with little to no knowledge about code looked great then. Soon I realized that this bulky CMS was now a modern day legacy software.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then came the new wave of JAMstack, pushed by Netlify. I loved the idea of building static sites that could be balzing fast and also I could control each bit of it as I was now building static HTML sites. It's then when my first website got acquired. Moving on this path I learned that I need to jump to a SSG because managing content was becoming tough. Here we are at Devxify, a site built with Gatsby in its core.
                </p>
                <h2>Tech Behind Devxify</h2>
                <p>
                  <b>Netlify:</b> It's an awesome service for all web developers. At Devxify, <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Netlify</a> is the main hosting platform where the site is built and deployed. 
                  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
                  <b>BunnyCDN:</b> Though Netlify is awesome and fast but I still needed a CDN to make my sites faster. There was Cloudflare as an option for CDN but their free CDN wasn't upto the mark. <a href="https://bunnycdn.com/?ref=mptrdjmh3n" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">BunnyCDN</a> became the perferct performance partner helping static assests load quickly.
                  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
                  <b>Cloudflare:</b> Though we don't use <a href="https://clodflare.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cloudflare's</a> CDN but that doesn't mean that they suck. They have one of the best DNS out there and speed is surely at the core of Devxify.
